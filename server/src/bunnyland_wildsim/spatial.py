"""Spatial helpers: find the holder of an item, and the room an entity is in.

The core ``container_of`` only returns an entity's *direct* ``Contains`` parent. For an
item being carried, that parent is the holding character, not the room. These helpers
resolve the two questions the survival mechanics actually ask:

- ``holder_of(item)`` — who is carrying this item (``None`` if it is loose in a room)?
- ``room_of(entity)`` — which room is this entity ultimately in, whether it is loose on the
  floor or nested in a character's inventory?
